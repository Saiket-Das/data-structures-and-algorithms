Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.

vector in C++ is the class template that contains the vector container and its member functions.

  vector<type>v          -> Construct a vector with 0 elements                                     -> O(1)
  vector<type>v(N)       -> Construct a vector with N elements and the value will be garbage       -> O(N)
  vector<type>v(N,V)     -> Construct a vector with N elements and the value will be V             -> O(N)
  vector<type>v(v2)      -> Construct a vector by copying another vector v2                        -> O(N)
  vector<type>v(A,A+N)   -> Construct a vector by copying all elements from an array A of size N   -> O(N)
